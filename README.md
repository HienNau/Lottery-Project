- Leveraging statistical knowledge (Uniform Distribution, Chi-Square tests) to prove the randomness and independence of lottery results.
Recommending that there are no discernible patterns or trends that can be exploited to predict future outcomes.

  - Conclusion: 
These methods can provide robust evidence regarding the randomness of lottery results.
Due to the independence and randomness of each draw, there are no patterns to exploit. 
Any attempt to predict future lottery numbers based on past results is statistically futile.
=> Warn about the financial and emotional risks associated with falling for lottery prediction scams. 
People can lose significant amounts of money chasing false hopes.
